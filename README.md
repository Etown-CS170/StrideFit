# StrideFit
This is a project for CS 170 that is a website that uses LM studios with llama-3.2-3b to generate a unique running schedule.

## Author
-   Rein Alderfer

## Purpose
-   To create custom running schedules for any goal.

## How To Run
-   The website runs by running off of live server or running the website locally. Then you need to launch LM Studio, I start it by using the llama-3.2-3b-instruct model and running it in development mode with the server. Make sure to enable CORS. Then you should get an output when using a fitnesses level in the dropdown box and inputting a running goal.

## Code attributation
-   Assume that the code is AI generated unless specified otherwise. All code was generated by ChatGpt 4o then I edited select parts to make the website fully functional.
